## Game Overview

Settlers of Catan (now simply called "Catan") is a multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber. It's a resource management and trading game where players:
- Take on roles of settlers on the island of Catan
- Build settlements, cities, and roads
- Trade resources with other players
- Race to be the first to reach 10 victory points

### Player Count
- Standard game: 3-4 players
- With expansion: up to 6 players
- Community variants exist for 2 players

### Game Duration
- Typical game: 60-120 minutes
- Varies based on player count and experience

## Game Rules and Mechanics

### Board Setup
1. **Hexagonal Board**: 19 terrain hexes arranged randomly
2. **Terrain Types**: 
   - Forest (produces wood)
   - Hills (produces brick)
   - Fields (produces wheat/grain)
   - Mountains (produces ore)
   - Pastures (produces sheep/wool)
   - Desert (produces nothing)
3. **Number Tokens**: Placed on non-desert tiles (2-12, no 7)
4. **Sea Frame**: 6 pieces forming the board edge

### Turn Structure

Each turn consists of three phases:

#### 1. Resource Production Phase
- Roll two dice
- All players with settlements/cities on hexes with the rolled number receive resources
- Settlements produce 1 resource card
- Cities produce 2 resource cards
- Rolling 7 activates the robber:
  - Players with 8+ cards must discard half
  - Active player moves robber to block a hex
  - Active player steals a card from an adjacent player

#### 2. Trading Phase
- **Domestic Trade**: Negotiate trades with other players
- **Maritime Trade**: Trade with the bank
  - 4:1 - Four of any identical resource for one of any other
  - 3:1 port - Three of any identical resource for one of any other
  - 2:1 port - Two of a specific resource for one of any other

#### 3. Building Phase
Build structures using resources:
- **Road** (1 brick + 1 wood): Connects intersections
- **Settlement** (1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep): Worth 1 VP
- **City** (2 wheat + 3 ore): Upgrades settlement, worth 2 VP
- **Development Card** (1 wheat + 1 sheep + 1 ore): Special abilities

### Development Cards
- **Knight**: Move the robber and steal a resource
- **Progress Cards**: Various special actions
- **Victory Point Cards**: Hidden VPs

## Victory Conditions

First player to reach **10 Victory Points** wins:

### Victory Point Sources
1. **Settlements**: 1 VP each
2. **Cities**: 2 VP each
3. **Longest Road**: 2 VP (5+ continuous roads)
4. **Largest Army**: 2 VP (3+ played knight cards)
5. **Victory Point Cards**: 1 VP each

## Strategy Elements

### Key Strategic Considerations
1. **Initial Placement**: Critical for resource access
2. **Resource Probability**: Tiles with 6 and 8 are most productive
3. **Resource Diversity**: Access to all five resources is valuable
4. **Port Access**: Reduces dependency on other players
5. **Blocking**: Strategic road and settlement placement
6. **Trading**: Negotiation skills are crucial

### Common Strategies
- **Ore-Wheat Strategy**: Focus on cities and development cards
- **Wood-Brick Strategy**: Expand quickly with roads and settlements
- **Balanced Strategy**: Maintain access to all resources
- **Port Strategy**: Leverage maritime trade advantages
